### Migration Guide

If you're using the old `CreateAudienceDialog`:

```typescript
// Before (v2.0.0)
<CreateAudienceDialog
  open={open}
  onOpenChange={setOpen}
  onSuccess={() => {
    refetch();
    setOpen(false);
  }}
/>

// After (v3.0.0)
<CreateAudienceDialog
  open={open}
  onOpenChange={setOpen}
/>
// Navigation to filter builder happens automatically
```

### Metrics

- **Research**: 9 filter categories documented
- **Specifications**: 700+ lines of documentation
- **TypeScript Types**: 200+ lines of type definitions
- **UI Components**: 2 new pages, 1 updated dialog

### Release Notes

This release represents a fundamental shift in our approach. Instead of building custom features and adding our own spin, we've created exact one-for-one copies of the AudienceLab platform pages. This ensures:

1. **Consistency** - Users familiar with AudienceLab will feel right at home
2. **Reliability** - We match the proven UX patterns of the official platform
3. **Maintainability** - Easier to keep in sync with AudienceLab updates
4. **Foundation** - Solid base for future custom features after core functionality is confirmed

The Audiences and Pixels pages are now carbon copies of the live AudienceLab dashboard at https://build.audiencelab.io, with all fancy features removed and structure matching exactly.

   - Bonus points for 3-6 words

2. **No Personas**: Prevents persona descriptors in Intent search
   - Detects: "people who", "users who", "customers who", etc.

   - Suggests specific terminology

7. **No Questions**: Enforces keyword format

   - Suggests converting to keyword format

#### Scoring Algorithm

```typescript
// Base: (passed_rules / 7) * 100
// Bonus: +5 for optimal length (3-6 words)
// Penalty: -5 per critical error
```

Score ranges:
- 90-100: Excellent (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)
- 75-89: Good (⭐⭐⭐⭐☆)
- 60-74: Fair (⭐⭐⭐☆☆)
- 40-59: Poor (⭐⭐☆☆☆)
